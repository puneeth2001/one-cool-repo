Remove spotify ads

This script reduces the volume to 0 when an ad is playing and resets it when a track plays. So no ads from now!! ðŸ˜Ž

go to your [account](https://www.spotify.com/in-en/account/overview/) page of spotify and copy the username and change `user` it in the script `rm_ad.py`

create a spotify app and use the client_id and client_secret.

for the first time it will ask you to enter the url that you are redirected to, copy paste the url after logging in.

enjoy ðŸ¥³
